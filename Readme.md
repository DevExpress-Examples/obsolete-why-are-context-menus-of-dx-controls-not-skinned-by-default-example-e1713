This example is obsolete. Place a [BarManager](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraBars.BarManager) or [RibbonControl](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraBars.Ribbon.RibbonControl) onto the form to apply a skinning paint theme to DevExpress context menus.
Ensure a control's **MenuManager** property (for example, [MenuManager](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.Container.EditorContainer.MenuManager)) is set to the created BarManager or RibbonControl object.

See the following ticket for more information: [Why are context menus of DevExpress WinForms controls not skinned by default?](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/K18257).
